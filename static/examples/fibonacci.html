  The fibonacci sequence implemented with a closure.
</p>

<p>
  Note that the last expression in a function is automatically the
  return value; there is no need to say "return x".  So the result
  of <code>m := result</code> is returned from the closure method, and
  the closure method itself is returned
  from <code>make-fibonacci</code>.
